## Project Proposal

**Cofounder Connect**

Project Description My app, "Cofounder Connect," is designed to bridge the gap between entrepreneurial minds seeking to launch or join startup ventures. It focuses on matching individuals based on their current educational institutions, offering a unique platform where users can find, connect, and team up with potential cofounders within their own school or university. Users can create profiles detailing their skills, interests, industry focus, and whether they're looking for someone with a technical background, business acumen, or other expertise. The app also allows users to browse through profiles, favorite potential matches, and initiate contact to discuss possible collaboration. Future updates will include features such as event organization within schools, mentorship programs, and integration with professional social networks to broaden the networking scope.
